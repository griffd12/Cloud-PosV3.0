# Cloud POS System

## Overview
This project is an enterprise cloud-based Point of Sale (POS) system designed for high-volume Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs). It provides a scalable solution with comprehensive administrative configuration and real-time operational features, supporting a multi-property hierarchy and integration with kitchen display systems (KDS). The system includes enterprise functionalities such as fiscal close, cash management, gift cards, loyalty programs, inventory management, forecasting, and online ordering integration. It employs a Simphony-class design for configuration inheritance with override capabilities and offers an optional Central Application Processing Service (CAPS) for hybrid cloud/on-premise offline resilience. The system aims to be a flexible and reliable POS for various QSR operations, ensuring continuous service even offline, and supporting both web and native applications (Android & Windows).

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
- **Release Notes Requirement**: Whenever a new Electron installer version is created (version bump in `electron/electron-builder.json`), always generate release notes summarizing all changes included in that version. Format them for use as GitHub Release descriptions.
- **Database Schema Documentation**: The file `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` in the project root is a living reference document that must be kept up to date whenever any database schema changes are made (new tables, columns, constraints, indexes, or relationship changes).

## System Architecture

### Core Design Principles
- **Multi-Property Hierarchy**: Supports Enterprise → Property → Revenue Center for scalable management.
- **Simphony-Class Configuration**: Configuration inheritance with override capabilities.
- **Touch-First UI**: High-contrast theming optimized for POS terminals.
- **Real-time Operations**: Utilizes WebSocket communication for KDS updates and CAPS synchronization.
- **Offline Resilience**: Features an optional on-premise CAPS with local SQLite for offline operations and cloud synchronization, ensuring an immutable `transaction_journal` for audit trails and exactly-once sync semantics.
- **Non-Destructive Changes**: System modifications are additive, with new features defaulting to OFF/NULL/false to prevent impact on existing enterprises.
- **Context Help Requirement**: Every configuration field in EMC panels requires a corresponding entry in the config help text registry for functional descriptions.

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, TanStack React Query, React Context, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, RESTful JSON API with WebSocket support.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Offline Storage**: Browser IndexedDB for client-side offline resilience.
- **Native Applications**: Capacitor (Android) and Electron (Windows) wrappers for web app deployment with full feature parity.

### Key Features and Implementations
- **Device Configuration**: Hierarchical setup for Workstations, Printers, and KDS Devices.
- **KDS Order Flow**: Supports "Standard Mode" and "Dynamic Order Mode" with real-time updates.
- **Authentication**: PIN-based employee authentication with role-based access control.
- **Payment Processing**: PCI-compliant, gateway-agnostic framework with semi-integrated architecture.
- **Printing System**: Database-backed print queue and standalone Print Agent System.
- **Enterprise Features**: Fiscal Close, Cash Management, Gift Cards, Loyalty, Online Ordering, Inventory, Forecasting.
- **Pizza Builder Module**: Visual, full-page interface for pizza customization.
- **Multi-Enterprise Architecture**: Server-side data isolation with distinct access levels.
- **Native Application Capabilities (Windows Electron)**: Includes embedded print agent, SQLite/SQLCipher for offline data, local reporting, store-and-forward for offline transactions, EMV terminal communication, auto-launch, kiosk mode, and terminal setup wizard.
- **Configuration Inheritance & Override**: Items inherit down the hierarchy with override capabilities tracked via a generic OptionBits system.
- **Concurrency-Safe Check Numbering**: Atomic check number generation ensuring unique, sequential numbers.
- **Reporting**: Canonical Data Access Layer with 7 query functions for FOH/BOH reports (e.g., Z Report, Cash Drawer, Daily Sales Summary).
- **Customer Onboarding Data Import**: Excel-based bulk data import system.
- **Delivery Platform Integration APIs**: Direct API integrations with Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub.
- **Offline Mode Resilience**: Features protocol interceptors, cached HTML/JS/CSS, and robust handling of offline transactions and manager approvals. CAPS auto-discovery and Yellow Mode provide seamless failover, while an immutable transaction journal ensures data integrity during synchronization.
- **Workstation Identity and RVC Switching**: Workstation ID is locked after setup, and the login screen allows interactive Revenue Center selection.
- **Device Tracker**: Unified device tracking for both WS and KDS Electron devices. KDS devices automatically tracked via ticket polling (kdsDeviceId fallback), WS devices tracked from login screen heartbeat. DeviceTracker summary shows device type (WS/KDS) and connection mode. Throttled DB writes (30s) to avoid excessive updates from 2s KDS polling.
- **CAPS Service Host Resilience**: Service host SQLite schema creation uses `ensureCriticalTables()` fallback to individually create essential tables (schema_version, sync_metadata, config_cache, sync_queue) if the main schema exec partially fails. Missing token triggers exit code 2 with patient 60-second retry instead of 5-second crash loop. Token is fetched fresh from cloud on each startup if missing from local config.
